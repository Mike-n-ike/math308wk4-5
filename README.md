#MATH 308 Wk 4-5 Assignment Details

Perform a principal component analysis on a data set of your choice. 

Submit a report summarizing your analysis in no more than 5 pages including 
a) a description of the variables and the source of the data; 
b) the key summary statistics, tables and graphs needed to follow your line of thinking; 
c) the conclusions of your analysis. 

The report should include an interpretation of the results, not just statistically, but also in layman terms within the context of the data at hand. 

Marks will be attributed for the quality of the report and the originality of the application, so examples covered in class or during the tutorials are clearly off limits. 

Your code should be appended to the report. 

We reserve the right to ask for the data file. 

As a safety measure, the team composition should be specified at the beginning of the report. 

A single copy of the latter need be submitted. All team members will receive the same grade
for their report.
